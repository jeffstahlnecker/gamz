## Summary
Gamz is an app where families, groups of friends, and communities can create their own *Gamz Server* with the overall purpose of playing card games and board games as a group. As part of this gaming service, they will be able to schedule games, chat with members in the same service, and video chat while playing a game.

While this specification document outlines the full specifications of the Gamz app, features will be rolled out in stages.
